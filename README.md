# Je12emy

Hi! My name is Jeremy and I'm a software engineer, I enjoy keeping things simple though I guess I'm not really good at it due to overthinking...

My current goals are:

* Learn Rust.
* Learn Go.
* Improve my Linux knowledge.
* Dive deep into a frontend framework, Solid looks very interesting.

Here are a bunch of repositories you could look at:

* [Dotfiles](https://github.com/Je12emy/dotfiles)
* [Go boiler plate](https://github.com/Je12emy/rest_boiler)
* [ASM 8086 car game](https://github.com/Je12emy/Game-asm)
* [ASM sample code](https://github.com/Je12emy/8086repo)
* [JS Archive](https://github.com/Je12emy/Archive)
